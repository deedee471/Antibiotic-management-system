Abstract

The Antibiotic Management System (AMS) project addresses the prevalent issue of manual antibiotic prescription processes at Victory Hospital, which are time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. This project aims to solve the problems associated with traditional methods of antibiotic management, including the difficulty of retrieving necessary data, a lack of real-time information sharing, and inefficiencies in monitoring patient responses to treatments. The research focused on developing a comprehensive AMS for Victory Hospital to streamline the prescription process, automate patient monitoring, and ensure adherence to treatment guidelines, ultimately improving patient care, reducing hospital stays, and lowering medical costs.

The objectives of the project included establishing a centralized digital platform for efficient antibiotic prescription management, facilitating real-time monitoring of patient history and treatment effectiveness, and designing a system capable of generating comprehensive reports to support decision-making. The methodology involved the development of a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for backend intercommunication, and MySQL for the database. Rigorous testing phases ensured the system's reliability and functionality, with a strong focus on maintaining patient confidentiality and data integrity.

Several challenges, including technical difficulties with module integration, user adaptation issues, and complex data migration processes, arose during the development process. Despite these challenges, the system successfully met its objectives, demonstrating robust functionality and ease of use. AMS implementation has significantly improved information management and operational efficiency at Victory Hospital.

The findings from the project suggest that automated systems can greatly enhance antibiotic management practices by providing reliable and accessible data, facilitating better decision-making, and reducing operational costs. Recommendations for future enhancements include continuous training for users, regular system upgrades, the development of efficient data migration tools, and the integration of user feedback to ensure the system evolves in line with user needs and industry trends.
